# An interactive coding exercise for Girls Who Code using the Board Game Geek API

Using APIs is a fun and easy way to get data from external sources.  In this exercise, we are going to display information to the screen about a particular board game a user is interested in.

1. Clone this repo using git on the command line: `git clone https://github.com/caguthrie/bgg_gwc.git`
2. Go into the directory: `cd bgg_gwc`
3. Install dependencies with npm: `npm i`
4. You can run the program, but it is incomplete (this is where you come in!).  You can run it with `node gameFinder.js`

Take a look at the code, and edit the `showUserGameData` function to display information to the screen your users may find useful.

Example response from looking at one "thing" with the API: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi2/thing?id=120677

I would also recommend you save your results by either forking this repo, or pushing up your completed work to a repo under your own account
